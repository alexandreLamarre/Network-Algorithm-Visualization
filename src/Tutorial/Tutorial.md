### Introduction

If it any time you're unsure about what a button does, you can hover over it for a description of what it does.

Similarly, if you're unfamiliar with an algorithm and wish to know more, you can use the search bar in the top right-hand corner to open its documentation.

#### What is a Network?

Abstractly, a network is built up from vertices(alternatively, nodes) and edges. The nodes of a network represent the data the network aggregates and the edges represent abstract connections between data. In practice, nodes can represent people, images, phones, ideas, rules, government policies, ..., pretty much anything you can think of! Similarly, edges can represent any kind of conenection between these nodes that we can come up with. Typically, we assign a weight to an edge based on how strong the connection is between the two nodes it connects.

#### Why are Networks Useful? 

In a world where data controls more and more of our interactions and products, **networks are pivotal**. Network optimization is an NP-hard problem, or in other words, a problem whose time it takes to solve scales exponentially with its size. This is a real issue because networks play a critical role in machine learning and AI optimization, compiler optimization, as well as in more general fields like marketing and social science, for example. By analyzing a network using the techinques in this web-app (and a hundreds of others not included in this web-app), we reduce the time it takes to optimize these networks and can gain key insights into their structure and behaviour.

#### Changing the properties of a network

You can change the properties of the network you want to analyze by openning the General Settings from the drop down menu in the top left corner of the window.

You can also access them from the bottom right 'network' wrench settings button.

**Settings Breakdown**:
- **Animation Speed** controls the speed at which each animation frame is displayed when running the algorithm.
- **Vertices** controls the number of vertices present in the network.
- **Edges** controls the number of vertices present in the network
- **Force Connectedness** dictates whether or not the network is connect. Network connectedness means that there is a path between every node in the network. In other words, there are no nodes completely disconnected from all other nodes.
- **Scale Vertex Size to Degree** scales the size of vertices to their degrees (the number of edges incident to).
- **Minimum Vertex Size** dictates the minimum size to be considered when scaling vertices to their degrees.
- **Maximum Vertex Size** dictates the maximum size to be considered when scaling vertices to their degree.
- **Start Color** dictates the start of the color gradient to be used when coloring vertices according to their degree.
- **End Color** dictates the end of the color gradient to be used when coloring vertices according to their degree.

#### 2D versus 3D

Both 2D and 3D networks are fully interactible: you can drag to move the network around and scroll to zoom in and out.

You can switch between displaying networks in 2d or 3d by clicking on networks2d/networks3d in the drop down menu in the top left corner of the window.


**3D Networks may be GPU intensive depending on your hardware**. There is no real advantage to displaying networks in 3D, exept when using spectral layout algorithms, which improve with the number of dimension you visualize (sadly, as humans we are limited to 3).

#### Random Network Generation

You can switch the way your network is randomly generated by clicking on this dropdown:

You can find additional information on random generation [here]().

### Selecting & Running Algorithms

You can skip forward or backward a frame in the animation by clicking on these buttons: 

![]()

You can skip forward or backward one second in the animation by clicking on these buttons:

![]()

You can skip to the start or end of the animation by clicking on these buttons:

![]()

You can clear the currently loaded algorithm by clicking on this button:

![]()

You can clear the way the network is colored by algorithms by clicking on this button:

You can reset the camera position, the way you view the network, by clicking on this button:

![]()

You can reset & generate a new random network by clicking on this button:

![]()

### Algorithm Settings

You can access algorithm settings from the drop down menu in the top left corner by clicking on 'algorithm settings':

![]()

You can also access algorithm settings by click the algorithm 'wrench' button next to where you select algorithms: 

![]()

Details that explain what these settings can be searched in the top right search bar and found in the documentation in the algorithm section.

### Custom Networks & Uploading Data

Currently, only .csv files can be uploaded for re-analysis in the network visualizer.

#### Creating your own networks

You can create your own networks by clicking on 'Create Custom Network' option from the drop down menu in the top left corner:

You can click on this button to place vertices on the frame:

![]()

You can click on this button to then click and drag to add edges between vertices:

![]()

You can click on this button to select area to drag and move on the frame: 

![]()
![]()

You can clear the frame by clicking on this button:

![]()

You can undo/redo the previous action by clicking on these buttons:

![]()



#### Uploading networks

You can upload .csv files to be analyzed by the wep-app by clicking on the dropdown menu in the left corner and selecting the 'upload data' option:
